The project that was initiated is a Python-based work that aims to mine through datasets to discover which functions are the best suitable for the training dataset. Some of the peculiarities include evaluating fifty given functions choosing the best functions to drive the test data, mapping the test data to the functions chosen, and producing visualizations using relevant tools like Bokeh and libraries like Pandas. Also, it follows object-oriented design principles, has an exception flow, and comprises validation through unit tests.
